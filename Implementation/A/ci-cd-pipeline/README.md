# CI/CD Pipeline Documentation

This repository contains a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline implementation using GitHub Actions, Docker, and modern DevOps practices.

## Architecture

The pipeline consists of the following stages:

1. **Build & Test**
   - Code checkout
   - Dependency installation
   - Unit tests
   - Linting

2. **Security Scan**
   - Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning
   - Code quality analysis

3. **Deployment**
   - Staging deployment
   - Production deployment with approval

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x
- Docker
- GitHub account
- Access to deployment environments

## Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run tests
npm test

# Build Docker image
docker build -t my-app .

# Run Docker container
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-app
```

## Pipeline Configuration

The pipeline is configured in `.github/workflows/main.yml` and includes:

- Automated testing on pull requests
- Security scanning with CodeQL
- Staged deployments (staging â†’ production)
- Environment-specific configurations

## Security Measures

- SAST scanning with CodeQL
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Environment segregation
- Protected branches

## Deployment

### Staging
- Automatic deployment on main branch updates
- Environment: staging

### Production
- Requires successful staging deployment
- Manual approval required
- Environment: production

## Monitoring

- GitHub Actions dashboard
- Deployment status tracking
- Security alert notifications

## Best Practices

1. Always write tests for new features
2. Keep dependencies updated
3. Review security scan results
4. Follow Git branch protection rules
5. Document significant changes

## Troubleshooting

- Check GitHub Actions logs for build failures
- Verify environment variables are properly set
- Ensure all required secrets are configured
- Review deployment logs for environment-specific issues
