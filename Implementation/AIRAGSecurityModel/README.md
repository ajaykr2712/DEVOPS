# AI-Powered RAG Model for Security Threat Analysis

This project implements an AI-Powered Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model specifically for security threat analysis.

## Structure

- `src/`: Source code for the RAG model, data processing, and API (if applicable).
- `data/`: Datasets used for training and retrieval (e.g., threat intelligence reports, logs).
- `models/`: Pre-trained models or model checkpoints.
- `config/`: Configuration files for the model, data sources, etc.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for experimentation and analysis.
- `docs/`: Project documentation.

## Getting Started

(Instructions on setting up the environment, data, and running the model will go here.)
