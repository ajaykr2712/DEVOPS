# Advanced DevOps Engineering Projects Portfolio

## Project 9: GitOps Infrastructure Automation Framework(I)

**Complexity Level: Expert**

### Description


Built a comprehensive GitOps framework using ArgoCD and Terraform for infrastructure automation, enabling declarative infrastructure management and automated deployment pipelines.


```
# Sample ArgoCD Application
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: infrastructure-apps
spec:
  project: default
  source:
    repoURL: https://github.com/org/infra-repo
    path: environments/production
    targetRevision: HEAD
  destination:
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
```
### Key Learning Objectives

- GitOps principles and practices
- ArgoCD and Terraform integration
- Infrastructure as Code
- Automated deployment pipelines
- Declarative infrastructure management
- Multi-cloud support
- Disaster recovery and backup strategies
- Cloud native architecture
- DevOps culture and practices
