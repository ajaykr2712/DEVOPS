# Advanced DevOps Engineering Projects Portfolio

## Project 1: CI/CD Pipeline Automation Framework (A)

**Complexity Level: Advanced**

### Description


Create an enterprise-grade CI/CD framework:
- Multi-cloud deployment
- Infrastructure as Code
- Security scanning
- Automated testing
- Release management
- Monitoring and logging
- Performance optimization
- Cost optimization
- Scalability and fault tolerance
- Disaster recovery and backup strategies
- Containerization and virtualization
- Cloud native architecture
- DevOps culture and practices

```
// Sample Jenkins Pipeline
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Security Scan') {
            steps {
                script {
                    def scanResults = securityScan()
                    if (scanResults.vulnerabilities > 0) {
                        error 'Security vulnerabilities found'
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
