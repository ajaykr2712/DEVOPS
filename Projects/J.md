# Advanced DevOps Engineering Projects Portfolio

## Project 10: Multi-Cloud DR Platform(J)

**Complexity Level: Expert**

### Description

Developed a multi-cloud disaster recovery platform with automated failover capabilities across AWS, GCP, and Azure.

```hcl
# Sample Terraform Multi-Cloud Configuration
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

provider "google" {
  project = "dr-project"
  region  = "us-central1"
}

provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

```

### Key Learning Objectives

- Multi-cloud architecture
- Disaster recovery planning
- Data replication strategies
- Automated failover
- Recovery time objectives (RTO)
- Recovery point objectives (RPO)
- Business continuity
- Cross-cloud networking
