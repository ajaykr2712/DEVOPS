# Advanced DevOps Engineering Projects Portfolio

## Project 4: Infrastructure Automation Platform (B)

**Complexity Level: Expert**

### Description



Build an infrastructure management platform:

- Multi-cloud deployment
- Infrastructure as Code
- Security scanning
- Automated testing
- Release management
- Monitoring and logging
- Performance optimization
- Cost optimization
- Scalability and fault tolerance
- Disaster recovery and backup strategies
- Containerization and virtualization
- Cloud native architecture
- DevOps culture and practices

```
# Terraform Multi-Cloud Example
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

provider "google" {
  project = "my-project"
  region  = "us-central1"
}
```

### Key Learning Objectives

- Multi-cloud deployment
- Infrastructure as Code
