## Introduction

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are essential components in modern software architecture, enabling different systems to communicate with each other. This guide focuses on two popular API paradigms:

1. **REST (Representational State Transfer)**: A widely adopted architectural style using HTTP methods
2. **gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call)**: A high-performance, open-source RPC framework

## REST APIs

<a name="rest-key-concepts"></a>
### Key Concepts

- **Resources**: Everything is a resource identified by URLs
- **HTTP Methods**: Uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- **Stateless**: Each request contains all information needed
- **Representation**: Resources can have multiple representations (JSON, XML, etc.)
- **HATEOAS**: Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State

### Implementation

This folder contains a complete REST API implementation with:

- Server implementation (Node.js/Express)
- Client examples
- Authentication and authorization
- Documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger
- Testing strategies

See the [rest-api](./rest-api/) folder for the complete implementation.

<a name="rest-best-practices"></a>
### Best Practices

- Use nouns, not verbs in endpoint paths
- Use HTTP methods appropriately
- Use proper HTTP status codes
- Implement pagination for large collections
- Version your API
- Use HTTPS
- Implement proper error handling
- Document your API

## gRPC

<a name="grpc-key-concepts"></a>
### Key Concepts

- **Protocol Buffers**: Language-neutral, platform-neutral extensible mechanism for serializing structured data
- **Service Definitions**: Define methods that can be called remotely with parameters and return types
- **Bidirectional Streaming**: Support for streaming in both directions
- **Code Generation**: Automatic client and server code generation
- **HTTP/2**: Built on HTTP/2 for improved performance

### Implementation

This folder contains a complete gRPC implementation with:

- Protocol buffer definitions
- Server implementation (Go)
- Client examples
- Authentication and authorization
- Testing strategies

See the [grpc-api](./grpc-api/) folder for the complete implementation.

<a name="grpc-best-practices"></a>
### Best Practices

- Design efficient protocol buffers
- Implement proper error handling
- Use streaming appropriately
- Implement deadlines and timeouts
- Use interceptors for cross-cutting concerns
- Implement proper load balancing
- Monitor and trace your gRPC services

## Comparison

| Feature | REST | gRPC |
|---------|------|------|
| Protocol | HTTP 1.1 | HTTP/2 |
| Payload Format | JSON, XML, etc. | Protocol Buffers (binary) |
| Contract | OpenAPI/Swagger | Protocol Buffers |
| Code Generation | Optional | Built-in |
| Streaming | Limited | Full bidirectional |
| Browser Support | Native | Limited (requires proxy) |
| Learning Curve | Low | Medium |
| Performance | Good | Excellent |
| Maturity | Very mature | Relatively new |

## When to Use Each

**Choose REST when:**
- You need maximum compatibility
- Your clients are primarily web browsers
- You want a simpler implementation
- You need a public API
- You have limited bandwidth requirements

**Choose gRPC when:**
- You need high performance
- You have well-defined service contracts
- You need bidirectional streaming
- You're building microservices
- You need strong typing
- You're working in a polyglot environment

## Integration with DevOps

Both REST and gRPC can be integrated into your DevOps workflows:

- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated testing and deployment
- **Containerization**: Docker images for API services
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes for scaling and management
- **Service Mesh**: Istio/Linkerd for advanced networking
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus/Grafana for metrics
- **Tracing**: Jaeger/Zipkin for distributed tracing
- **API Gateways**: Kong/Ambassador for management

The implementations in this folder include examples of these integrations.
