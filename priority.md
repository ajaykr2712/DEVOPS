# DevOps Expert Level Projects Priority List

## 1. Infrastructure Automation Platform

### Project Overview
Develop a comprehensive Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) solution using Terraform to provision and manage AWS infrastructure, incorporating scripting and networking components.

### Key Components
1. Terraform configurations for AWS resources
2. Python/Bash scripts for automation
3. VPC and networking setup
4. AWS services integration (e.g., EC2, RDS, S3)

### Action Items
- [ ] Set up Terraform Certainly! I'll create a plan for these two projects that you can include in the priority.md file. This plan will help you stay focused on completing these expert-level projects according to their assigned priority.

Here's the content you can add to your priority.md file:

# DevOps Expert-Level Projects Priority List

## 1. Infrastructure Automation Platform

### Project Overview
Develop a comprehensive Infrastructure as Code (IaC) solution using Terraform to provision and manage AWS infrastructure.

### Key Components
1. Terraform modules for core AWS services
2. VPC and networking setup
3. Security group and IAM role management
4. S3 bucket for Terraform state management
5. Python or Bash scripts for additional automation

### Action Items
- [ ] Set up a new GitHub repository for the project
- [ ] Create a basic VPC module with Terraform
- [ ] Implement EC2 instance provisioning
- [ ] Develop an RDS database module
- [ ] Create an S3 bucket module
- [ ] Implement IAM roles and policies
- [ ] Develop a module for ELB/ALB setup
- [ ] Create helper scripts for environment management
- [ ] Implement a CI/CD pipeline for Terraform (e.g., GitHub Actions)
- [ ] Write comprehensive documentation and usage examples

## 2. Microservices Orchestration Platform

### Project Overview
Build a Kubernetes-based platform for orchestrating microservices, leveraging AWS EKS and implementing robust CI/CD practices.

### Key Components
1. AWS EKS cluster setup
2. Kubernetes manifests for deployments, services, and ingress
3. Helm charts for common services
4. Service mesh implementation (e.g., Istio)
5. CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions or Jenkins

### Action Items
- [ ] Set up a new GitHub repository for the project
- [ ] Create Terraform module for EKS cluster provisioning
- [ ] Develop base Kubernetes manifests for a sample microservice
- [ ] Implement Helm charts for common platform services (e.g., monitoring, logging)
- [ ] Set up ingress controller and configure routing
- [ ] Implement service mesh (Istio) for advanced networking features
- [ ] Develop CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments
- [ ] Implement secrets management (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault)
- [ ] Create scripts for cluster management and troubleshooting
- [ ] Write comprehensive documentation, including architecture diagrams

## Next Steps
1. Begin with the Infrastructure Automation Platform project
2. Once the core infrastructure is in place, start working on the Microservices Orchestration Platform
3. Regularly commit code and update documentation
4. Seek code reviews and feedback from peers or mentors
5. Continuously refine and expand the projects based on new learnings and best practices
