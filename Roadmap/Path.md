# The Only Road map I follow and got inspired is from "Devops Tech BootCamp by Nana"

## Categorized them into levels

# Level 1 - DevOps Pre-Requisites

### Many newcomers to Cloud and DevOps struggle due to a lack of foundational
knowledge. These modules bridge that gap by providing essential foundational
knowledge

# Level 2 - DevOps Fundamentals

### Now, your DevOps journey really starts. These are really the non-negotiable skills
for a DevOps engineer. You will be learning Cloud basics and gaining hands-on
experience working with remote VMs in the Cloud, as well as artifact repositories with Nexus and containerization with Docker.



# Level 3 - DevOps Core

### Here we take your skills to an advanced level and speed up your career growth.
You will be learning CI/CD pipelines, container orchestration with K8s, complex
cloud infrastructure with AWS, K8s on AWS with EKS and building multiple real
life capstone projects with all of the tools you have learned in each of the previous modules.

Real-world Implementation Flow:
```

Developer pushes code → Triggers CI pipeline
Build Docker image → Scan for vulnerabilities
Deploy to EKS staging → Run automated tests
4. Promote to production → Blue/Green deployment
Monitor with Prometheus → Auto-scale based on metrics
6. Infrastructure changes → Terraform plan/apply
Configuration updates → Ansible playbooks
```
# Level 4 - DevOps Advanced

### Elevate to an expert level by mastering 4 tools of automating every part of your
systems! Terraform for infrastructure, Ansible for configuration management, Python
for any kind of smaller flexible task automation and finally monitoring with
Prometheus for detecting and alerting any issues in your systems automatically.

```
Terraform manages cloud infrastructure
Ansible ensures consistent server configurations
Python handles log analysis/automation
Prometheus monitors systems and triggers alerts
```
