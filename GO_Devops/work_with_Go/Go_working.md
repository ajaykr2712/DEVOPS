# Go for DevOps Mastery - Structured Learning Path

## 1. Core Go Fundamentals
### 1.1 Language Basics
- Syntax and structure
- Data types and variables
- Control structures (if/else, loops)
- Functions and packages

### 1.2 Concurrency Model
- Goroutines and channels
- sync package (WaitGroups, Mutexes)
- Context package for cancellation
- Worker pools patterns

## 2. DevOps-Centric Go Programming
### 2.1 CLI Tool Development
- Cobra/Viper frameworks
- Configuration management
- Cross-compilation for binaries
- Logging with zap/logrus

### 2.2 Infrastructure Interaction
- Docker SDK for Go
- Kubernetes client-go
- Cloud SDKs (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- Terraform provider development

## 3. Advanced DevOps Patterns
### 3.1 CI/CD Systems
- Pipeline development
- Plugin architecture
- Artifact management
- Integration with Jenkins/GitLab CI

### 3.2 Observability Tools
- Metrics collection (Prometheus client)
- Distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry)
- Log aggregation pipelines
- Health check implementations

## 4. Production-Grade Practices
### 4.1 Performance Optimization
- Profiling (pprof)
- Memory management
- GC tuning
- Benchmark testing

### 4.2 Security Considerations
- Secrets management
- TLS configuration
- SAST integration
- Vulnerability scanning

## 5. Real-World Projects
1. Build a container orchestration helper
2. Create a custom CI/CD pipeline runner
3. Develop infrastructure monitoring agent
4. Implement cloud resource automator
5. Design a deployment canary system

## Learning Resources
- **Books**: "Go Systems Programming", "Cloud Native Go"
- **Courses**: Gophercises, Learn Go with Tests
- **Tools**: GoReleaser, GoMock, Testcontainers
- **Communities**: Gophers Slack, DevOps Go Notary

# Implementation Roadmap
1. Master core language features (2 weeks)
2. Build basic CLI tools (1 week)
3. Integrate with cloud APIs (2 weeks)
4. Develop orchestration helpers (3 weeks)
5. Implement full CI/CD system (4 weeks)

> Regular practice with infrastructure automation projects is crucial. Start with simple automation scripts and gradually move to distributed systems.
