# 100 Days of Data Science and Machine Learning ðŸš€

## Overview

Welcome to my **100 Days of Data Science and Machine Learning** journey! This repository is a dedicated space where I will document my daily progress as I dive deep into the fascinating world of Data Science and Machine Learning. The goal is to build a solid foundation, explore various tools and techniques, and work on real-world projects, all while sharing my learnings with the community.

## Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **Daily Logs:** Each day, I will update a markdown file with detailed notes, code snippets, and reflections on what I've learned.
- **Projects:** A collection of mini-projects and Kaggle competitions that I will undertake during this challenge.
- **Resources:** A curated list of books, courses, articles, and tools that I find useful throughout my journey.

## Day 0: Kickoff

- **Date:** August 11, 2024
- **Focus:** Planning and Setup
- **Summary:** Today, I laid the groundwork for the next 100 days. I set up this GitHub repository, outlined my learning plan, and prepared my tools and resources. Iâ€™m excited to embark on this journey!

## How to Follow Along

- **Daily Updates:** I will commit updates to this repository every day.
- **Twitter:** Follow me on [Twitter](#) for real-time updates and insights.
- **Projects:** Check out the `Projects` folder to see the hands-on work Iâ€™m doing.

## Goals

1. **Master the Fundamentals:** Gain a deep understanding of core Data Science and Machine Learning concepts.
2. **Build Projects:** Apply what I learn by working on real-world projects.
3. **Community Engagement:** Share knowledge and connect with fellow learners through GitHub and Twitter.
4. **Document Everything:** Maintain a comprehensive log of my learning process to track progress and stay motivated.
