# Lists vs. Sets in Python

## Lists

- **Ordered Collection:**
  - Lists maintain the order of elements as they are added.
  - Elements can be accessed using their index.

  ```python
  my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  print(my_list[0])  # Output: 1
  ```

  ## Mutable:

Lists allow modification of elements after their creation.
python
```
my_list[1] = 10

```
