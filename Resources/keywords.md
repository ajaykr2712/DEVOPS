### Python Keywords: An Overview

Keywords in Python are reserved words with predefined meanings and specific purposes. These words cannot be used as variable names or identifiers because they play a crucial role in defining the structure and logic of Python programs. Being case-sensitive, they must be written exactly as specified.

Hereâ€™s an explanation of some key Python keywords:

1. **`and`**: A logical operator that returns `True` only if both operands are true.  
2. **`or`**: A logical operator that returns `True` if at least one operand is true.  
3. **`not`**: A logical operator that inverts the truth value of its operand.  
4. **`if`**: Marks the start of a conditional statement, followed by a condition to determine if the code block should execute.  
5. **`else`**: Used with `if` to define an alternative code block when the condition is `False`.  
6. **`elif`**: Stands for "else if," enabling additional conditions after an initial `if`.  
7. **`while`**: Creates a loop that runs as long as a specified condition remains true.  
8. **`for`**: Defines a loop that iterates over a sequence (e.g., list, tuple, or string).  
9. **`in`**: Checks for membership in a sequence, often used with `for` loops.  
10. **`try`**: Starts a block of code for exception handling.  
11. **`except`**: Defines a block of code to execute when an exception is raised in the `try` block.  
12. **`finally`**: Specifies a block of code that will always execute, whether or not an exception occurs.  
13. **`def`**: Used to define a function in Python.  
14. **`return`**: Specifies the value to be returned by a function.  
15. **`class`**: Used to define a class, the blueprint for creating objects.  
16. **`import`**: Allows importing modules or libraries into the program.  
17. **`from`**: Used with `import` to bring specific components from a module.  
18. **`as`**: Assigns an alias to a module or component for easier reference.  
19. **`True`**: Represents a boolean value of "true."  
20. **`False`**: Represents a boolean value of "false."  
21. **`None`**: Indicates a special null value or absence of value.  
22. **`is`**: Compares the identity of two objects, checking if they refer to the same memory location.  
23. **`lambda`**: Defines small, anonymous functions.  
24. **`with`**: Used for context management to ensure certain operations are performed before and after a block of code.  
25. **`global`**: Declares a variable as global, allowing its modification within a function.  
26. **`nonlocal`**: Declares a variable as nonlocal, enabling its modification in an enclosing (non-global) scope.
