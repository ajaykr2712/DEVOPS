# Optimizations
Meaningful Function Name: Renamed the function to get_server_status for clarity, as the function retrieves the server's status specifically.

Improved Documentation: Added a detailed docstring to describe the function's purpose, parameters, and return value.

Simplified Print Statement: Updated the print statement for a clearer output message.

This version is more readable, maintainable, and informative for anyone using or reviewing the code.
