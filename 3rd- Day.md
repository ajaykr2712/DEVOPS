**Detailed Notes:**

📝 **Types of Machine Learning Problems:**
- **Classification:** Assigning data into categories (e.g., spam vs. not spam).
- **Regression:** Predicting a continuous value (e.g., predicting house prices).
- **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points together (e.g., customer segmentation).

📝 **Framework for ML Problems:**
- **Understand the Problem:** Clearly define what you need to predict or classify.
- **Data Exploration:** Examine your dataset to understand the variables and patterns within.
