## 📚 Today's Focus: **Advanced Hyperparameter Tuning in Machine Learning**

### 🔍 **Topics Explored:**
- **Grid Search vs. Random Search:**
  - Compared the exhaustive nature of Grid Search with the probabilistic approach of Random Search.
  - Analyzed the efficiency of each method in different scenarios.

- **Bayesian Optimization:**
  - Studied how Bayesian Optimization can outperform traditional methods by intelligently selecting hyperparameters based on prior results.
  - Implemented a simple Bayesian Optimization technique using the `skopt` library.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning in Deep Learning:**
  - Focused on tuning hyperparameters for deep neural networks using libraries like `Keras Tuner` and `Optuna`.
  - Discussed the trade-offs between tuning depth (e.g., layers, nodes) and width (e.g., learning rate, batch size).

### 🛠️ **Code Implementation:**
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import RandomizedSearchCV
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from scipy.stats import randint

# Define the model
model = RandomForestClassifier()

# Define the parameter distribution
param_dist = {
    "n_estimators": randint(50, 200),
    "max_depth": randint(3, 20),
    "min_samples_split": randint(2, 11)
}

# Perform Randomized Search
random_search = RandomizedSearchCV(model, param_distributions=param_dist, n_iter=100, cv=5)
random_search.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Best parameters
best_params = random_search.best_params_
print(f"Best parameters: {best_params}")
```

📝 Reflections:
Understanding the balance between exhaustive searches like Grid Search and more efficient methods like Random Search or Bayesian Optimization is crucial for optimizing model performance without wasting resources.
Bayesian Optimization, though complex, offers a more strategic approach to hyperparameter tuning, particularly in large-scale problems.
