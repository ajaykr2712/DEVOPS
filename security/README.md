## 🛡️ Security Framework

Our security approach follows industry best practices and includes:

- **Shift-Left Security**: Security integrated into the development lifecycle
- **Zero Trust Architecture**: Never trust, always verify principle
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time security monitoring and alerting
- **Compliance Automation**: Automated compliance checking and reporting

## 🔒 Core Security Controls

### 1. Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Principle of least privilege
- Regular access reviews and audits

### 2. Secret Management
- Centralized secret storage (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
- Secret rotation automation
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- No hardcoded secrets in code

### 3. Network Security
- Network segmentation and microsegmentation
- Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- DDoS protection
- VPN and secure connectivity

### 4. Application Security
- Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
- Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
- Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST)
- Dependency vulnerability scanning

### 5. Infrastructure Security
- Infrastructure as Code security scanning
- Container image vulnerability scanning
- Runtime security monitoring
- Host-based intrusion detection

## 🔍 Security Scanning Tools

### SAST (Static Analysis)
```yaml
# Example: Semgrep configuration
rules:
  - id: hardcoded-secrets
    pattern: |
      password = "..."
    message: "Hardcoded password detected"
    severity: ERROR
    languages: [python, javascript, go]
```

### Container Scanning
```bash
# Trivy container scanning
trivy image --exit-code 1 --severity HIGH,CRITICAL myapp:latest

# Grype vulnerability scanning
grype myapp:latest --fail-on high
```

### Infrastructure Scanning
```bash
# Checkov for Terraform/CloudFormation
checkov -f main.tf --framework terraform

# Terrascan
terrascan scan -t terraform -f main.tf
```

## 📋 Compliance Frameworks

### SOC 2 Type II
- Access controls and monitoring
- System operations and availability
- Processing integrity
- Confidentiality and privacy

### GDPR Compliance
- Data protection by design
- Privacy impact assessments
- Data breach notification procedures
- Right to be forgotten implementation

### HIPAA (Healthcare)
- Administrative safeguards
- Physical safeguards
- Technical safeguards
- Audit logging and monitoring

### PCI DSS (Payment Processing)
- Secure network architecture
- Cardholder data protection
- Vulnerability management program
- Access control measures

## 🚨 Incident Response

### 1. Preparation
- Incident response team formation
- Communication procedures
- Tool and resource preparation
- Training and awareness programs

### 2. Detection and Analysis
- Security monitoring and alerting
- Log analysis and correlation
- Threat intelligence integration
- Incident classification and prioritization

### 3. Containment and Eradication
- Immediate containment procedures
- Evidence collection and preservation
- Threat eradication strategies
- System recovery procedures

### 4. Post-Incident Activities
- Lessons learned documentation
- Process improvement recommendations
- Stakeholder communication
- Legal and regulatory reporting
