# 🚀 Day 14 - September 4, 2024

## **Today's Focus:**
- **Deep Dive into Advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) Techniques**

### **Overview:**
Today's focus was on exploring cutting-edge NLP techniques, specifically focusing on transformer-based models like BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformers). The goal was to understand their architecture, use cases, and how to fine-tune them for domain-specific applications.
