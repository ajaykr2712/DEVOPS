**Today's Focus:** Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

## Overview
- Data cleaning is essential for ensuring that your dataset is free from errors, inconsistencies, and missing values.
- Preprocessing involves transforming raw data into a format suitable for machine learning models.

## Key Concepts
- **Handling Missing Data:** Techniques include imputation (e.g., mean, median, mode) or removing rows/columns with missing values.
- **Outlier Detection:** Identifying and handling outliers that can distort your data analysis.
- **Data Normalization:** Scaling features to a standard range (e.g., 0 to 1) to ensure they have equal weight during model training.
- **Data Transformation:** Converting categorical data to numerical formats using techniques like one-hot encoding.

## Examples
- **Imputation Example:** Using `SimpleImputer` in Python's `sklearn` to fill missing values:
    ```python
    from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
    imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='mean')
    cleaned_data = imputer.fit_transform(raw_data)
    ```

- **Outlier Detection Example:** Using Z-score to detect outliers:
    ```python
    from scipy import stats
    import numpy as np

    z_scores = np.abs(stats.zscore(data))
    outliers = np.where(z_scores > 3)
    ```

- **Normalization Example:** Using `MinMaxScaler` for feature scaling:
    ```python
    from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

    scaler = MinMaxScaler()
    normalized_data = scaler.fit_transform(raw_data)
    ```

## Use Cases in Data Science & ML
- Ensuring that your model is trained on clean, consistent data for more accurate predictions.
- Reducing the risk of biased results due to outliers or incorrectly processed data.
- Preparing your dataset for more complex transformations and model applications.

## Reflections
- Effective data cleaning and preprocessing can make a significant difference in model performance.
- Understanding the nature of your data is crucial for choosing the right preprocessing techniques.

## Next Steps
- Apply data cleaning and preprocessing techniques to a real-world dataset.
- Explore more advanced methods such as PCA for dimensionality reduction.
