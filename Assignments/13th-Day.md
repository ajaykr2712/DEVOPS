# 🚀 Roadmap for Building a Strong Profile in Machine Learning & AI

## 📅 Day 13 - September 3, 2024

### **Today's Focus:**
- **Advanced Machine Learning Techniques for Water Quality Prediction**

### **Overview:**
Today, I deep-dived into utilizing advanced machine learning algorithms such as XGBoost, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to develop models for predicting water quality issues. The goal was to create a robust predictive model that can help monitor and manage water quality in real-time.

## **Activities:**

1. **📊 Dataset Exploration and Preprocessing:**
   - Utilized a publicly available water quality dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
   - Conducted an initial Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and correlation of different water quality parameters like pH, hardness, turbidity, and chemical concentrations.
   - Identified missing values and handled them using techniques such as mean imputation and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

2. **🔍 Feature Engineering:**
   - Created new features to enhance the predictive power of the models, such as interaction terms between different chemical concentrations and environmental factors.
   - Normalized and standardized data to ensure that all features contribute equally to the model performance.

3. **🧑‍💻 Model Development:**
   - Developed multiple models using Python libraries such as `scikit-learn` and `xgboost`.
   - Implemented baseline models using logistic regression and decision trees to compare against more advanced techniques.
   - Trained advanced models like XGBoost, Random Forests, and SVM, fine-tuning hyperparameters to maximize accuracy and minimize overfitting.

4. **📈 Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluated the performance of each model using cross-validation, confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC curves.
   - Analyzed which features were most influential in predicting water quality using model interpretability techniques like SHAP values.

5. **🌐 Research and References:**
   - Referenced research papers and articles on the application of machine learning for environmental monitoring:
     - [Water Quality Prediction using Machine Learning](https://example.com/research-paper)
     - [XGBoost: A Powerful Tool for Data Science](https://example.com/xgboost-guide)
     - [Feature Engineering for Environmental Data](https://example.com/feature-engineering)

6. **📘 Documented Findings:**
   - Detailed documentation of the approach, model performance, and insights gained from the analysis was added to the repository’s README file.
   - Created Jupyter notebooks for each step: data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation, to ensure reproducibility and transparency.
