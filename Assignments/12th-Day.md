### Today's Focus: Iron Particles in Water Quality Analysis

**Activities:**
- Explored the effects of minute iron particles in water, particularly their impact on safety in environments like swimming pools.
- Reviewed methods for detecting and mitigating these particles to ensure water safety.
- Studied the application of data science in environmental monitoring and water quality analysis.

### Reflections:
- Understanding the presence of iron particles in water is crucial for public health and safety.
- Data science can play a significant role in early detection and prevention of water contamination.

### Next Steps:
- Dive deeper into water quality datasets to identify patterns and anomalies related to contamination.
- Develop a small project focused on predicting water contamination using machine learning models.
